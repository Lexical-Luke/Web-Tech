difficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

Edit Chapter04-project02.html and Chapter04-project02.css so the page looks similar to that shown in Figure 4.31.

Instructions

1. The form at the top of this page consists of a text box, and two drop-down lists. 
   For the Genre list, make the other choices “Baroque,” “Renaissance,” and “Realism.” 
   The drop-down list items should have numeric values starting with O. Notice the placeholder text in the search box.
   
2. Create a table of paintings that looks similar to that shown in Figure 4.31. Be sure to make the table properly accessible.

3. The checkboxes in the table should be an array of elements, e.g., <input type="checkbox" name "index[]" value="10" />. 
   The name and values are arbitrary, but each checkbox needs to have a unique value.
   
4. The button in each row is a <button> element with a dummy link.

5. Set the form’s method attribute to POST and its action attribute to http://
   www.randyconnolly.com/tests/process.php.
   
Test

1. Test the form in the browser. Verify that the output from process.php matches that shown in Figure 4.31.
