Project 1: share Your travel photos
DifficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

This exercise walks you through the usage of a static class variable, and simple data encapsulation. 
It builds on the structure you have from Chapter 9 Project 2, but replaces arrays of arrays with a single array 
of objects of type TravelImage.

Instructions
1. Create a file named TravelPhoto.class.php and within it define a class named TravelPhoto, which has private properties: 
date, fileName, description, title, latitude, longitude, and ID.

2. Define a static member variable named photoID, which will be used to set each instance’s ID value and then be incremented, 
all inside the class constructor.

3. Create a constructor that takes in fileName, title, description, latitude, and longitude.

4. Implement the __toString() method that should return the HTML markup for an <img> element for the member data within 
this object. This <img> element should also have alt and title attributes set to the value of the object’s title property.

5. Open travel-data-classes.php. Notice that it contains instantiations of TravelPhoto objects inside an array.

6. Modify your Chapter09-project02.php to use the array of objects within travel-data-classes.php rather than the data 
in travel-data.php. Hint: Use your new __toString() method.

Testing

1. Open your script in a browser to see the output. You should see output identical to that in Figure 9.14.

2. Hover over the image to ensure the title attribute of each image is set.

3. Clicking the link will still take you to travel-image.php with the id element
passed as a query string parameter.
