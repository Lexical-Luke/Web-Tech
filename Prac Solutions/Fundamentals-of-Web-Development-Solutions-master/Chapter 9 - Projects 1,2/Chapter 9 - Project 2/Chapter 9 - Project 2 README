Chapter 9 - Project 2

Project 2: share your travel photos 
DifficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

You have been provided with two files: a page that will eventually contain thumb- nails for a variety of travel 
images (Chapter09-project02.php) and a page that will eventually display the details of a single travel image 
(travel-image.php). Clicking a thumbnail in the first file will take you to the second page where you will be 
able to see details for that image, as shown in Figure 9.14.

Instructions

1. Both pages will make use of arrays that are contained within the include file travel-data.php. 
Include this file in both pages.

2. Both pages make use of an include file called travel-left-rail.php, which contains the markup for the navigation 
rail on the left side of both pages. Replace the hard-coded continents and countries lists in the file with loops 
that output the equivalent markup but use the data defined in the arrays. After verifying that it works, use the 
appropriate sort functions to sort the continents and countries arrays alphabetically. For the country list, notice 
that the links include the code in the query string.

3. Within Chapter09-project02.php in the <div> below the Favorites heading, replace the existing markup with a loop 
that displays the thumbnail image and link for each of the elements within the $images array (which is provided within 
travel-data.php). Notice that the links are to travel-image.php and that they pass the id element as a query string parameter.

4. In travel-data.php, retrieve the passed id in the query string, and use it as an index into the $images array. 
With that index, you can output the relevant title, image (in the images/travel/medium folder), user name, country,
and description.

Test

1. Test the pages in the browser (see the test section of the previous section to remind yourself about how to do this).
