Project 1: art store 
DifficuLty LEvEL: Beginner

Overview

Demonstrate your ability to work with arrays and superglobals in PHP.

Instructions

1. You have been provided with two files: the data entry form (Chapter09 -project01.php) and the page that will process 
the form data (art-form-process .php). Examine both in the browser.

2. Modify Chapter09-project01.php so that it uses the POST method and art-form-process.php as the form action.

3. Modify art-form-process.php so that it displays the email, first name, last name, and privacy values that were 
entered into the form, as shown in Figure 9.13. This will require using the appropriate superglobal array. 
Also display the first name and last name in the welcome greeting.

4. In art-form-process.php, define an array that contains the labels for the account menu (see Figure 9.13). 
Replace the hard-coded list in the file with a loop that displays the equivalent list using the contents of your 
just-defined array. Notice that some conditional logic will be required to add the class="active" attribute to the 
correct <li> element.

5. Modify art-footer.inc.php so that it includes the array defined within art-data.php. 
Replace the hard-coded markup in the file with a loop that outputs the equivalent markup but uses the data defined 
in the array.

Test

1. Test the page. Remember that you cannot simply open a local PHP page in the browser using its open command. 
Instead you must have the browser request the page from a server. If you are using a local server such as XAMMP, 
the file must exist within the htdocs folder of the server, and then the request will be 
localhost/some-path/Chapter09-project01.php.
